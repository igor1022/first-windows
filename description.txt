The elevator has a list of possible floors, a link to the current floor (where it is located), a link to the floor
where the passenger is (when the passenger presses the call button, he gives this information). The engine has a 
link to the current state (breakdown or serviceability), the doors have a link to the current state (breakdown or 
serviceability) and a link to whether they are open or not. The person has a link to the button that they click. 
Further, the steps of the elevator movement follow in stages (on the way, the doors open, the doors close, 
the elevator goes down or up). Also, if a person presses a button with a non-existent floor, the elevator will
write about it. Also, the elevator will warn you if the engine or doors are broken.
